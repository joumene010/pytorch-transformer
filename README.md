🚀 Transformer Model Implementation

📌 Overview

This project is an implementation of a Transformer model inspired by the paper "Attention Is All You Need." The model was built by following a YouTube tutorial and involves training, validating, and inferring using a Transformer-based architecture. Although the project was initially forked, the process followed the tutorial step by step for better understanding and hands-on experience.

✨ Features

📖 Transformer Architecture: Implements the original Transformer model.

🎯 Training Pipeline: Trains the model on a dataset using attention mechanisms.

🏆 Validation: Evaluates model performance on test data.

🔍 Inference: Generates predictions using the trained model.

⚡ PyTorch-based Implementation: Uses PyTorch for deep learning computations.

🛠 Technologies Used

🤗 PyTorch: Deep learning framework for building and training the model.

📑 Attention Mechanism: Key concept from the Transformer paper.

📊 Training & Evaluation: Implements loss functions and optimization techniques.
